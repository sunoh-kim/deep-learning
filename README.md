# Deep Learning - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my assignment solutions for the Deep Learning course (M2177.003100_002) offered by Seoul National University (Fall 2019).

The algorithms for the assignments are implemented using TensorFlow and PyTorch in Python.


### Assignment0 (TensorFlow):
Environment Setup, Linear Model 

### Assignment1 (TensorFlow):
Data Curation, Implementing Neural Networks from Scratch, Neural Networks 

### Assignment2 (TensorFlow):
Implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Training CNN, Visualizing CNN 

### Assignment3 (TensorFlow):
Implementing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Image Captioning, Language Modeling

### Assignment4 (TensorFlow):
Implementing Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with MNIST data, Implementing Conditional-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with MNIST Data, Implementing Conditional-GAN with Face Data

### Assignment5 (TensorFlow):
Implementing and Training a Deep Q-Network (DQN), Playing Atari games using an Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) agent 

### Final Project (PyTorch):
Text-to-image Synthesis based on [AttnGAN](https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN)
